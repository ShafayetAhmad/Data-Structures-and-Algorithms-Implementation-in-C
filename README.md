# Data Structures and Algorithms Implementation in C

This GitHub repository contains the code implementations of various data structures and algorithms learned from Abdul Bari's course on Data Structures and Algorithms. The repository serves as a reference for understanding and implementing common data structures and algorithms in C.

### Contents

The repository includes implementations of the following data structures and algorithms:

#### Data Structures
- Array
- Linked List (Singly, Doubly, and Circular)
- Stack
- Queue (including Circular Queue)
- Binary Tree (including Binary Search Tree)
- Heap (including Max Heap and Min Heap)
- Hashing (including open addressing and chaining)

#### Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms (including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Radix Sort),
- Searching Algorithms (including Linear Search, Binary Search, and Hashing),
- Graph Algorithms (including Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, 
- Graph Algorithms (including Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, and Kruskal's Algorithm),
- Dynamic Programming (including Fibonacci Series and Knapsack Problem),
- Greedy Algorithms (including Huffman Coding and Activity Selection Problem)

### Usage

You can clone this repository and use the code as a reference to understand the implementation of various data structures and algorithms. Each implementation is organized in separate folders according to the programming language used and includes comments for better understanding. You can also use the code as a starting point for your projects or assignments related to data structures and algorithms.
